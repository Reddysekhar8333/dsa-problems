bit manipulation:
-------------------
1.binary number conversion (1's & 2's complement)
2.operations( AND,OR,XOR,NOT,SWIFT(left&right) )
3.swap 2 numbers
4.check is the ith bit is set or not
5.extract the ith bit
6.set the ith bit
7.clear the ith bit
8.toggle the ith bit
9.remove the last set bit(right most)
10.count the number of set bits
11.check if the number is a power of 2 or not
12.minimum bit flips to convert number
13.power set (print all subsets)
14.Single Number (1,2,3) problems
15.divide two numbers without division operators
